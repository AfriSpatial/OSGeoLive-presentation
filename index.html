<p>GRASS GIS provides powerful raster, vector, and geospatial processing. It includes tools for spatial modeling, visualization of raster and vector data, management and analysis of geospatial data, and the processing of satellite and aerial imagery. It also provides the capability to produce sophisticated presentation graphics and hardcopy maps.</p>
<p>GRASS is used around the world in academic and commercial settings as well as by many governmental agencies and environmental consulting companies. The GRASS software includes over 400 built-in analysis modules and 100 community supplied modules and toolboxes.</p>
<p>After 27 years of continuous development GRASS is both the oldest and largest Open Source GIS available. It is capable of very powerful analysis, but may not be as simple to get started with as other offerings with more of a geodata viewer focus. Many Open Source projects make use of GRASS's algorithms.</p>

<p>In 2003, the Ministry for Transport and Infrastructure in Valencia, Spain, started migrating all their systems to Open Source Software. Part of this migration involved the development of gvSIG to replace ESRI desktop applications in use.</p>
<p>gvSIG is a desktop GIS application designed for capturing, storing, handling, analysing and deploying any kind of referenced geographic information in order to solve complex management and planning problems.</p>
<p>gvSIG is available in over 20 languages, and has a very strong following amongst Spanish speakers. gvSIG is also available in a mobile version which integrates with the desktop application.</p>

<p>OpenJUMP is a spin-off from the original JUMP project, which was Open Source but didn't accept improvements and updates from the community. This resulted in over 10 forks of the original code base. OpenJUMP provided a merging back together of many of these forks. </p>
<p>OpenJUMP is an easy to use and powerful deskstop GIS that enables users to edit, analyse, and display geographic data. It is particularly good at conflation, which involves aligning a feature which is shown in different locations on two different map layers.</p>
